# Parkinsons_disease_project


The goal of this project is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor 
symptoms associated with Parkinson's.

In this project, I develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinsonâ€™s disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.
The two models that I have used are random forest and lasso regression.
